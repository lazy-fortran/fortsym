# Fortran API

`use fortsym` provides the expression type, arena type, constructors, operators,
and the expression functions under their ordinary Fortran names such as `exp`,
`sqrt`, and `erf`. The facade follows the same vocabulary as `fortsym_expr`;
the generic interfaces accept expression handles while the language's intrinsic
names remain the natural spelling for native symbolic expressions.
The lower-level `fortsym_expr` and `fortsym_arena` modules remain available.

Symbol names follow one rule: name the symbol as you would name the Fortran
variable, using the spelling that the printer reads. Names such as `varphi_2`,
`gamma_1`, `theta_bar`, and `B_r_hat` work as symbolic names, Fortran
identifiers, and readable typeset input. Never put LaTeX markup in a symbol
name. A name such as `\varphi_2` is the arena identity and is emitted verbatim
by every dialect. Use the notation override map when the desired notation
cannot be a Fortran identifier.

Fortran emission validates symbol names at the source boundary. Invalid names
such as `\[Alpha]` or `Global`x` are refused with a diagnostic rather than
written into generated source. Symbolic names remain case-sensitive; when a
kernel contains both `Gamma` and `gamma` (or `B` and `b`), only the colliding
Fortran spellings are deterministically renamed and the generated source
records the mapping in a comment.

## Default arena

Assigning character data to an `expr_t` creates one symbol. The right-hand side
is treated as a name, so `x = "x+y"` creates a symbol named `x+y` and does not
parse an expression.

```fortran
use fortsym
type(expr_t) :: mu, sigma, e

mu = "mu"
sigma = "sigma"
e = (mu + 1) / sigma
```

The module owns one saved default arena for the process lifetime. It is a
single-threaded convenience state. `default_arena()` returns the same arena
when an explicit constructor needs to share that state. `reset()` is safe
before first use and can be called more than once. It clears the node store and
invalidates every expression made before the reset, including handles whose
node index is reused later. The arena pointer remains usable after reset.
Discard pre-reset expressions at every reset boundary. Use explicit arenas for
concurrency, isolation, and library code that outlives one problem.

`symbols` assigns whitespace- or comma-separated names to scalar outputs:

```fortran
call symbols("mu sigma best xi", mu, sigma, best, xi, ok=good)
```

`good` is false when an output has no corresponding name or when extra names
remain. The output without a name is an invalid `expr_t`.

## Explicit arenas

An explicit arena remains the first-class API for independent problems and
concurrent work:

```fortran
type(arena_t), target :: a
type(expr_t) :: x

call a%init()
x = sym(a, "x")
```

Expressions built with an explicit arena can use every operator and expression
function exported by `fortsym`. Expressions combined by an operator must belong
to the same arena. The default and explicit forms can be mixed when the
explicit constructor receives `default_arena()`.
The core operations use the expression's owning arena, so the same `subs`,
`diff`, `simplify`, `expand`, and `factor` calls work without an explicit-arena
variant or a second calling syntax.

## Core operations

The easy facade uses the same short names as the owning modules:

```fortran
f = (x + 1) * (x + 2)
g = subs(f, x, y, ok, why)
d = diff(f, x, ok, why)
s = simplify(f, ok, why)
e = expand(f, ok, why)
p = factor(f, ok, why)
```

`diff` is the evaluated native derivative. The `fortsym_diff` module remains
available for the deliberately unsimplified derivative DAG. `subs` is structural and
simultaneous for its one replacement pair. `simplify`, `expand`, and `factor`
use the native engine in the expression's arena. All five functions return an
`expr_t`. On refusal they return an invalid handle, set `ok` false when it is
present, and put a diagnostic in the allocatable `why` when it is present.
Successful calls set `ok` true and clear `why`. Callers that omit the optional
outputs can still detect failure with `is_valid`.
