# fortsym roadmap

The target is **100% coverage of the fortsym-bench corpus**: 384 Wolfram-language
derivations across 50 projects, every result either agreeing with an open-source
oracle or refused with a named construct. Nothing here is scheduled by taste —
each milestone is ordered by how many corpus scripts it unblocks, and every
method is chosen from the literature and cited.

Operational rules live in `doc/roadmap.md`. Licences and clean-room boundaries
live in `LEGAL.md` and `COMPATIBILITY.md`. Method provenance lives in
`doc/provenance.md`, and every algorithm below has an entry there.

## Acceptance

A milestone is done when it has a callable public operation, an **independent**
behavioural oracle (not another CAS agreeing with it), documentation, a
reproducible benchmark row, and a measurable rise in corpus coverage. A
capability bit is added only with the operation it describes. Unsupported input
returns a diagnostic or `UNKNOWN` — never a guess.

## Performance contract

Performance is a release criterion, not a follow-up.

| Workload | Target | Current |
|---|---|---|
| expand, diff, simplify on the SymEngine benchmark inputs | within **1.5×** of SymEngine 0.14.0 | 2.66× on `(x+y+c)^7` |
| any corpus script | faster than SymPy on the same input | not yet measured |
| generated kernel runtime | at or below the hand-written routine it replaces | not yet measured |

Rules that follow from that contract:

- Sparse multivariate arithmetic uses **heap-based multiplication and division**
  (Monagan & Pearce 2007, 2010), which is the current state of the art for
  sparse distributed polynomials and beats geobucket at the sizes the corpus
  reaches. Dense univariate falls back to **Kronecker substitution** onto FLINT
  `fmpz_poly`.
- The arena stays hash-consed with cache-dense node layout. No allocation in
  inner loops; memoisation keyed on interned ids.
- Every claim cites a pinned result file under `benchmark/results` produced with
  fixed CPU affinity and a documented frequency governor. A run without those is
  diagnostic and cannot support a release statement (`doc/benchmarks.md`).

## Measured state

Latest corpus-wide measurement, 2026-08-01, `fortsym-bench` at 384 scripts
(`--jobs 4`, with the final SymPy, Mathics, and native rows cached):

| | |
|---|---:|
| scripts completing natively | **381 / 384 (99%)** |
| of those with non-empty result sets | 343 |
| valid empty native result sets | 38 |
| scripts refusing with a named construct | 2 |
| scripts exceeding the time budget | 1 |
| crashes | **0** |
| cold two-oracle audit after translator refresh | 4:54 |
| warm compact raw-output and verdict audit | about 2 s |

Read that honestly: 99% is *native scripts that ran and emitted bindings*, not
correctness. Scoring against an oracle is what makes it coverage.

The final binding-level audit reports 2,992 agreements, 908 declared
differences, 20 unsupported outcomes, 40 timeouts, 135 errors, 201 oracle
disagreements, and 799 oracle-missing bindings. The target remains open until
the declared native subset and the available oracle overlap agree.

### The oracle ceiling (#47)

That number is now established, and it changes the target.

| | scripts | share |
|---|---:|---:|
| Mathics produces results | 235 | 61% |
| fortsym-wl completes | 381 | 99% |
| **Mathics and fortsym-wl both complete** | **233** | **61%** |

Mathics fails on 149 scripts: 117 errors and 32 timeouts. Those outcomes are
cached by source digest and Mathics runner version, so later native audits do
not rerun the oracle.

**100% coverage is unreachable with Mathics as the sole oracle**, and no amount
of fortsym work changes that: 145 natively completed scripts currently have no
successful Mathics result to compare against. The benchmark now also compares
native results against SymPy when Mathics is unavailable and requires both
oracles to agree before scoring a shared binding. Raising the ceiling means
completing the SymPy translation/runtime, reporting the Mathics defects
upstream, or adding a third oracle for the overlap.

Until it moves, every coverage number states its denominator. "99% complete
natively" and "61% share a successful Mathics result" are different
claims.

The current cold figure includes the SymPy refresh required by the translator
cache-version change and the native refresh required by the rebuilt binary.
Once raw results and comparison verdicts are cached, the same full audit takes
about 2 seconds. These are harness measurements, not a capability
comparison: Mathics evaluates integrals fortsym refuses, and the native path
still has one 60-second timeout.

What running the corpus has already bought, none of which was found by tests:

- A parser segfault on `-Inverse[g] . c`, from negating a term that had already
  failed to parse. Five scripts crashed; now none do.
- `wl_eval` dispatched only on `NK_FUNC`, so `1 + Integrate[x, x]` reported the
  unevaluated `Integrate` as though it were the answer. Unimplemented heads
  nested in arithmetic now refuse.
- The `Series` order convention, off by one against Mathics in both directions.
- Implicit multiplication, the single largest parse-refusal cause.
- Refusing `Transpose[jac]` for a symbolic `jac`, which disagreed with the
  oracle on a *correct* answer — Mathics leaves it unevaluated too.

The current native baseline is 2 named refusals and 1 timeout at script level;
binding-level unsupported constructs remain tracked by the benchmark report.

### What the corpus says to build next

Refusals grouped by cause, measured rather than guessed. This is the list that
orders the work, and it has repeatedly disagreed with intuition:

| Cause | Refusals |
|---|---:|
| parse | 518 → 279 |
| plotting family (Show, Plot3D, ContourPlot, Graphics, ListPlot, …) | ~300 |
| `Solve` beyond the scalar linear case | 78 |
| definite and multiple `Integrate` | ~123 |
| `N` with a requested precision | 90 |
| polynomial heads (`Coefficient`, `Together`, `Factor`, …) | ~60 |
| `DSolve` / `NDSolve` | 45 |

Two findings worth keeping:

- **Plotting is the largest single construct family**, mostly from teaching
  material, and fortplot already provides contour, contourf, pcolormesh,
  surface, scatter, streamplot and quiver. Nothing upstream is missing.
- **239 of the 518 parse refusals were one bug**, not missing syntax: a
  statement was split at every depth-zero newline, so a derivation broken after
  a trailing operator was truncated into a prefix that still parsed. Measuring
  causes rather than counting messages is what found it.

### How defects are found here

Every module added since the corpus went live has been written, then attacked
by an independent reviewer whose brief is to produce a wrong answer with real
program output, not to approve. That pass has found, among others: an
antiderivative emitting `log` without an absolute value; a positivity predicate
treating `exp(z)` as positive for imaginary `z`, reintroducing the very
`sqrt(x*y)` sign error its own docstring quoted; a limit deciding the
power-domain rule from an exponent *after* substitution, asserting a finite
limit for a function undefined on both sides; a summation guard defeated by
integer overflow in its own term count.

None of these were caught by the modules' own tests, all of which passed. The
lesson is recorded here because it sets the standard for new work: a passing
test written by the same author as the code is weak evidence, and the review
pass is not optional.

## Milestones

Ordered by corpus impact. Counts are call sites across the 384-script corpus.

### M1 — Polynomial and rational core (#28) · 2189 sites

Content, primitive part, exact division, GCD, square-free decomposition,
resultant, `cancel`, `together`, `apart`, `factor`.

- GCD: **sparse modular** (Zippel 1979) with **dense modular** (Brown 1971) for
  low variable counts, and **GCDHEU** (Char, Geddes & Gonnet 1989) as the fast
  path for small inputs. Monagan & Wittkopf (2000) for the sparse-modular
  refinements.
- Univariate factorisation: **Zassenhaus** with **van Hoeij lattice
  reduction** (van Hoeij 2002) to kill the exponential recombination case.
- Multivariate factorisation: **EEZ / Wang** multivariate Hensel lifting
  (Wang 1978).
- Oracle: divisibility, Bezout, and finite-field evaluation — not another CAS.

### M2 — Assumptions (#29) · 895 sites

Inequality ranges, domain membership, scoped contexts, `refine`, compound
inference.

- Representation: an immutable fact set with a **congruence-closure**-style
  propagation over interned expressions (Nelson & Oppen 1980).
- Oracle: sampling within the declared domain; a rewrite must hold at sampled
  admissible points and be refused outside them.

### M3 — Series (#35) · 321 sites

Laurent series, expansion at infinity and at singular points, composition,
inversion, series of special functions.

- **Lazy/recursive power series** with Newton iteration for reciprocal and
  reversion; **Brent & Kung (1978)** for composition.
- Order convention documented and identical in both frontends. Wolfram's
  `Series[f,{x,0,n}]` includes `x^n`; SymPy's `series(f,x,0,n)` does not.
  fortsym-bench found this on its first corpus entry.

### M4 — Limits (#32) · 137 sites

- **Gruntz's algorithm** (Gruntz 1996) over most-rapidly-varying subexpressions.
  It is the only method in wide use that is correct on nested exponentials, and
  it is what SymPy implements.
- Taylor-derived limits first for the cheap finite cases.

### M5 — Complex domain (#33) · 782 sites

`re`, `im`, `conjugate`, `arg`, guarded `abs`, `complex_expand`, and promotion
of the bounded `qqbar` bridge into arena nodes.

- Exact algebraic numbers through **FLINT `qqbar`** (Johansson 2020), already
  pinned as a dependency.
- Oracle: high-precision evaluation and `z * conj(z) == abs(z)^2`.

### M6 — Special functions (#34) · 1040 sites

Bessel `J`,`Y`,`I`,`K`; gamma family; `erf`/`erfc`; elliptic `K`,`E`,`F`;
Legendre.

- Numerics through **Arb** ball arithmetic (Johansson 2017), which gives
  rigorous enclosures rather than best-effort floats.
- Symbolic relations from **DLMF** (Olver et al.), cited per rule.
- Unblocks KiLCA, whose entire conductivity tensor is Bessel and gamma.

### M7 — Integration (#31) · 350 sites

- Rational part: **Hermite reduction** then **Lazard–Rioboo–Trager** for the
  logarithmic part. Bronstein, *Symbolic Integration I* (2005), is the reference
  implementation guide.
- Then the **Risch** algorithm for elementary extensions, in the decision-
  procedure form, not a heuristic table.
- Oracle: differentiate the answer and decide zero.

### M8 — Solving (#36) · 76 sites

Univariate roots by radicals to degree four, `RootOf` representation above,
elimination for systems, Gröbner only where a traced case needs it
(**F4**, Faugère 1999; bounded Buchberger otherwise).

### M9 — Matrices (#30) · 589 sites

- Determinant and linear solve by **fraction-free Bareiss** (Bareiss 1968).
- Rational systems by **Dixon p-adic lifting** (Dixon 1982), which is the fast
  path and what makes large exact systems tractable.
- Eigenvalues via characteristic polynomial through M8.

### M10 — Numerics and the fortnum boundary (#37) · 686 sites

Requested-precision real and complex evaluation, `NIntegrate`, `FindRoot`,
`Interpolation`, `Fit`.

**Anything numerical that is not symbolic-expression evaluation belongs in
fortnum, not here** — quadrature, root finding, interpolation and fitting are
fortnum's subject. fortsym contributes only the evaluator that turns an
expression into a callable, plus the bridge. Work lands in fortnum when the
corpus demands a routine fortnum lacks, and nowhere else.

- Ball arithmetic through **Arb**; adaptive quadrature via
  **Gauss–Kronrod** with the Petras/Molin rigorous-error treatment for the cases
  that need certification.

### M11 — Plotting through fortplot (#44) · 2794 sites

`Plot`, `Plot3D`, `ContourPlot`, `ParametricPlot`, `ListPlot`, `StreamPlot`,
`DensityPlot`, `VectorPlot`, `LogPlot`, `Show`, `GraphicsGrid`, `PlotLegends`.

Plotting was a deferred area. The corpus makes it the **single largest
construct family**, mostly from the teaching material, so it is scheduled.

fortsym does not gain a plotting implementation. It gains a **dependency on
fortplot**, which already provides plot, contour, contourf, pcolormesh, surface,
3-D, scatter, streamplot, quiver, errorbar, subplots and legends. fortsym's job
is sampling an expression into arrays and mapping options; anything missing is
fixed **in fortplot**, upstream, not worked around here.

### M12 — Sums, piecewise, trig rewrites, ODEs (#38, #39, #40, #43)

Indexed sums (**Gosper 1978**, **Zeilberger 1990** for the hypergeometric
cases), piecewise with branch emission, public trig/power rewrites, and finally
`DSolve`.

### M13 — Codegen completion (#41, #42)

Binding opaque applied functions and their `Derivative` nodes to
consumer-supplied procedures, and mapping special-function heads to a Fortran
runtime. #41 is what unblocks SIMPLE's canonical-field Hessians; #42 is what
lets KiLCA's orphaned generated kernels be regenerated.

## Simplification strategy

Candidate ranking stays the mechanism: generate candidates, verify equivalence,
rank by operation count after CSE. Beyond that, **bounded equality saturation**
over an e-graph (Willsey et al., *egg*, POPL 2021) is evaluated only once M2's
domain guards exist — an e-graph that rewrites without guards will happily prove
something false on a restricted domain.

## What stays out

Units, geometry, combinatorics and broad theorem proving remain outside the
corpus and therefore outside the plan. New corpus evidence can promote any of
them.
